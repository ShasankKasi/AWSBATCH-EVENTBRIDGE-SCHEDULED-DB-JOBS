# AWS Batch + EventBridge Scheduler – Scheduled Database Jobs

This repository contains a reference implementation for running **scheduled and ad-hoc database workloads on AWS** using **AWS Batch with Fargate** and **EventBridge Scheduler**.

The solution demonstrates how to:
- Run containerized SQL workloads as Batch jobs
- Trigger jobs using cron or one-time schedules via EventBridge Scheduler
- Execute workloads in private subnets using Fargate
- Securely fetch database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
- Capture execution logs using CloudWatch Logs and store outputs in Amazon S3

All infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, and workloads are packaged as Docker images.

## 🏗️ Architecture (High Level)

EventBridge Scheduler → AWS Batch Job Queue → Fargate Compute Environment  
→ Containerized PowerShell workload → Database (RDS)  
→ Logs in CloudWatch, outputs in S3

## 📌 Notes

- This repository is intended as a **reference architecture**, not a reusable Terraform module
- An existing database and S3 bucket are required
